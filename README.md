## Credits
This software is part of [Project Asakura](https://github.com/ProjectAsakura).

It was first started by [Astelle Nightshade](https://github.com/ry00001), but most of the game's features were implemented by [Kitsu](https://github.com/shiroikitsu8).

Special thanks:

## Donations
Donations are not required, however I'm only one person, and I'm still a student, so if you want to thank me for my work, [please buy me a coffee or two](https://ko-fi.com/lostkagamine).

This won't get you anything other than my gratitude, the entire project is and will always remain available to everyone for free.
